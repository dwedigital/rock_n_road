The 60 minutes\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinclude a thorough warm up consisting of easy running, mobilisation work, dynamic\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstretching, drills and strides. This warm up also focuses on improving various aspects of\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\trun technique, biomechanics and efficiency. Not only will interval training improve your\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tperformance at all distances but it\u2019s a really fun and social way to train. Anyone and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\teveryone can benefit from interval-training regardless of experience level or goals. The\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcoaches are on hand throughout to answer questions or help you tailor the session to suit\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyour own ability.\nThe main set is usually interval-based, meaning that there is some faster-paced running for a\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tset time or distance, interspersed with recovery which is either easy jogging, walking or\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstanding. The aim of each interval session is to improve a certain aspect of our physiology,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuch as our pace at Lactate Threshold, Vo2 Max or increase our Running Economy and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNeuromuscular Efficiency.\nThese sessions are also individualised for each attendee as we regularly carry out 3k and 5k\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttime trials (or use a recent race result) to ascertain pace zones for different running\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tintensities. This allows you to run at the right effort and avoid overexerting and\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tovertraining.\nThe first session is free and all subsequent sessions are \u00a35, unless you are a member\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the Rock n Road Runners run club.
